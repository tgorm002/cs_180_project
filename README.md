# cs_180_project

For this project my team and I were instructed to create a webiste that was able to display NBA analytics. We used Flask and python for our backend servers to open, read, modify, and display the csv files we were given. Our csv files, games.csv, games_details.csv, teams.csv, rankings.csv, and players.csv all hold information about every game and player in the NBA since 2004. All of these csv files can be found in the dataset folder within the backend folder. The backend folder also holds the backend.py file where we created all functions for analytics. We used React and JavaScript for our frontend to display all the analytics and data that our backend created. All frontend files can be found in the frontend folder. 

This first screenshot is our home page. The NBA logo in the top left corner takes the user back to the home page.

For this project my team and I were instructed to create anything that could be sold as a product. We decided that we would create a product called RateYourSkills, which would give employees a way to inform their employer which programming languages they are strongest in and what projects they would like to work on. As a team, we found that employees who were interested and skilled in the project they were working on almost always produced better work.

We created a basic website using python through the use of the Flask libraries, HTML, and CSS. Assuming that you do not have Flask installed on your computer, you cannot run the files. I have attached four screenshots below of what the website looks like. 

This first screenshot is our home page.

This fourth screenshot is the page that will appear once the user has logged in. This page allows the user to input their information to submit to their employer. If the user wants, they can click on the links on this page to increase their programming skills in the languages shown below.
